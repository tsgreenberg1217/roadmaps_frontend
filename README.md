## About Roadmaps

* Roadmaps allows users to create trips and invite friends on your trips.
* To help users plan trips, each trip profile is given a google map that updates routes and arrival time every time a user creates or rearranges their stops on their trips.
* Each stop contains a profile page where users can post pictures of the places they've been and things they've done.

# How to use it.

## Signing up
* The first page is the signup page, so sign up with a username and a password.

## Creating a Trip
* Click the 'create trip' button and fill in the name of your trip (some examples would be 'California Trip' or 'Birthday Roadtrip') and upload a picture to associate with your trip (optional).
* Once the trip is created, click 'go' on your trip card to enter the trip profile.

## Using your Trip Profile

### Invites
* On the right hand side of the screen, there is a form where you can invite friends to your trip. If the user exsists, their name will appear on the right (that user will then have access to the trip through the 'invite' tab)

### Stops
* On the upper-left hand side of the window, there is a form that allows you to create stops. By default, every stop you create is the next place you will be going.
* You will notice that each stop have 'up' and 'down' buttons. This allows you to re-arrange your stops. So 'up' means you will arrive at that stop earlier, and down means you will arrive at that stop later.
* Next to the up and down arrows, you will see a picture icon. Clicking on that will bring you to the pictures page of the stop.

### Pictures
* On the top of the window, first submit something you did at the place (an example would be "Grand Ole Opry" if your stop is Nashville). You will then have a section were you can upload pictures of your activity.
